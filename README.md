## Overview

This repo hosts **all source code** written in the tutorials.

The goal of the tutorials is to:

1. Cover the fundamentals

Due to time constraints, we simply cannot cover *everything* there is to know. We want to teach you **how things really work**, so that you won't get confused when you start digging deeper yourself, the key to success still lies heavily on your own curiosity.

2. Have you walk away with 2 projects

Everyone says it but it's true, **you learn by doing**, you don't know the difficulties you'll face until you've tried doing it yourself, so this is a great opportunity to use the fundamentals you've learnt to solve the issues you'll face by yourself. By the end, we hope you'll have something to showcase on your resume!

From week1-week5 we are going to create a simple HTML/CSS/JS portfolio website

From week5-week9 we are then going to create a fullstack CMS to support our portfolio site

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the tutorials, **basic programming skills are needed**:

- variables, conditional statements, loops
- functions
- data types
- basics of OOP (classes and objects)

Everything else will be covered
